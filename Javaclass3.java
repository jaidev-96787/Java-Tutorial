        // What is programming in computer language ?

        // => Programming is the process of designing and writing instructions for a computer to perform a
        // specific task. The instructions are written in a programming language, which is a language designed
        // to be understood by computers. A programmer writes a program, which is a set of instructions that the
        // computer follows to complete a task. Programs can range from simple scripts to perform basic
        // operations to complex software applications with multiple functions and features. Some common tasks
        // performed by programs include performing mathematical calculations, displaying information on a
        // screen, processing user input, storing and retrieving data, and communicating with other devices or
        // systems. The purpose of programming is to automate tasks, solve problems, and create new and innovative
        // applications to meet the needs of users and organizations.

        //-----------------------------------------------

        // What is Java ?

        // => Java is a high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle
        // Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It is an object-oriented language that is designed to be portable
        // across different platforms, which means that Java programs written on one platform can run on another
        // platform without modification. Java is commonly used to build standalone applications, web
        // applications, and mobile apps, as well as being a popular choice for developing large-scale enterprise
        // applications. Java is also used in scientific computing, financial applications, and games
        // development, among other areas.

        //-----------------------------------------------

        // why is java as compare to any other programming language ? OR Advantage.

        // => Java has several advantages compared to other programming languages that have made it a popular
        // choice for software development:

        // 1. Platform independent: Java is designed to run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
        // installed, making it highly portable. This means that Java programs can run on any operating system,
        // including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

        // 2. Object-Oriented: Java is a pure object-oriented programming language, which means that all code
        // written in Java is organized into objects, making it easier to write, maintain, and understand.

        // 3. Rich API: Java has a large and comprehensive API, which provides a wide range of functionality,
        // including I/O, networking, and XML parsing.

        // 4. Secure: Java is designed with security in mind, making it a good choice for developing applications
        // that handle sensitive information. Java's security features include automatic memory management and
        // secure class loading.

        // 5. Scalability: Java is highly scalable, making it suitable for large-scale enterprise applications.
        // Java's scalability is due to its support for multithreading, which allows multiple tasks to be
        // executed simultaneously.

        // 6. Wide Adoption: Java is widely used by organizations, developers, and students, which means that
        // there is a large community of developers who can provide support and resources, as well as a large
        // pool of job opportunities for Java developers.

        //--------------------------------------------------------------

        // Introduction of Java

        // Java is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was first released in 1995 by Sun
        // Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation). It is an object-oriented language that is designed
        // to be portable and platform-independent, which means that Java programs can run on any device that
        // has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.
        // Java is used to develop a wide range of applications, including standalone applications, web
        // applications, mobile apps, games, and enterprise software. It has a large and comprehensive API,
        // which provides a wide range of functionality, including I/O, networking, and XML parsing. Java is
        // also known for its security features, which make it a good choice for developing applications that
        // handle sensitive information. With its wide adoption, Java has a large and active community of
        // developers, which provides support and resources for learning and using the language.

        //------------------------------------------------------------

        // What is compiler

        // => A compiler in Java is a software program that takes the source code written in Java programming
        // language and converts it into machine-readable code, which is then executed on a computer. The
        // compiled code runs faster than the source code because it's in a format that can be executed directly
        // by the computer's processor.

        //The Java compiler is an important part of the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is the standard
        // development environment for Java programming. The Java compiler is invoked from the command line
        // using the javac command. It takes one or more source files as input and produces class files that
        // contain the compiled code. These class files can then be executed using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
        //
        //In summary, the compiler in Java is responsible for taking the human-readable Java source code and
        // transforming it into the machine-executable code that can be run on a computer.

        //------------------------------------------------------------------

        // What is JRE, JDK, JVM in java in simple language ?

        // => Java has three important components that work together to run Java programs:

        // 1. JRE (Java Runtime Environment): JRE is a software package that provides the minimum requirements to
        // run Java applications and applets. It contains the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and
        // supporting files.

        // 2. JDK (Java Development Kit): JDK is a software development kit that provides the tools and libraries
        // necessary for developing Java applications. It includes the JRE, as well as the Java compiler,
        // debuggers, and other tools that developers need to create and test Java applications.
        //
        // 3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine): JVM is the heart of the Java platform. It is responsible for executing
        // Java bytecode, which is the compiled code of a Java program. The JVM interprets the bytecode, executes
        // the instructions, and manages the memory used by the application.

        // To run a Java program, you need to have JRE installed on your computer. If you want to develop Java
        // applications, you need to have JDK installed, which includes the JRE and other tools necessary for
        // development. JVM is an integral part of JRE and JDK and is used to execute the Java code.

        //-----------------------------------------------------------------

        // What is means by public class Name in java ?

        // => In Java, the public keyword before the class keyword in a class declaration indicates that the
        // class is a public class. This means that the class can be accessed from anywhere in the code,
        // including other classes and packages.
        //             The name after the class keyword is the name of the class, which is used to identify
        //             the class. The name should follow the Java naming conventions, which specify that the
        //             first letter of the name should be uppercase and subsequent words in the name should be
        //             capitalized (also known as camelCase).

        //-----------------------------------------------------

        // What is means by public static void main (String [] args) in java ?

        // In Java, "public static void main(String[] args)" is a method signature for the main method, which is
        // the entry point of a Java application. The main method is called when the program starts executing.

        // The "public" keyword before the "static" keyword indicates that the main method can be called from
        // anywhere in the code. The static keyword means that the method belongs to the class and can be called
        // without creating an instance of the class.

        // The "void" keyword indicates that the main method does not return any value.

        // The "main" method takes an array of strings as a parameter, represented by "String[] args". The "args"
        // parameter is used to pass command line arguments to the program. The command line arguments are
        // stored in the "args" array, which can be accessed and processed within the main method.

        //Here's an example of a main method in Java:

//        public class MainClass {
//          public static void main(String[] args) {
//            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
//          }
//        }
        //In this example, the main method prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console.

        // Loops in Java

        // For-Loops, While-Loops, do-while Loops.
